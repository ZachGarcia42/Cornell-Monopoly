Hello! Here's a brief overview of how the game works: At the
beginning of each turn, we roll a pair of die for you and advance
your character that many spaces on the game board. We give you useful
information like your current bank account balance, the current
square you're on, and a few tiles around you. Then, you are prompted
to enter your next action based on what square you're on. Note that
you must enter exactly what's prompted in most cases, although you
will still be charged for rent, taxes, and other things regardless of
what you enter (so tax evasion isn't possible)! We also maintain a
leaderboard (printed out at the beginning of each round) that's based
on how much cash players have (not counting value of assets, so this
can be deceptive!). Hope this helps!
