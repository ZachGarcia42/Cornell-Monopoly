  This project is an online version of the famous game, Monopoly, themed around
  Cornell locations, landmarks, and inside jokes. The interface shows the user
  the entire board, their location on the board, and relevant features of the
  board (prices, property ownership). The user will choose possible
  actions such as rolling dice, selling properties, and paying tax. The user will
  be able to move their piece around the board, view property details, and view
  community chest style cards. After the user's turn, other players will take
  their turn. All of this interface will be created using a terminal library.
